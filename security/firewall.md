#### Firewall
- Any device that regulates the movement of information across networks from the outside world, known as the untrusted network, to the inside of the organization, known as trusted network.
- Combination of Hardware and Software
- Types
  - Packet filtering firewalls
  - Stateful packet inspection firewall
  - Application layer proxy firewall
    - Firewall + Proxy
  - Unified Threat Management devices
- Architectures
  - Bastion Host Model/Sacrificial host model
  - Screened Host Model
  - Screened Subnet Model
- Configuration Best practices
  - Firewall should never be managed from outside the network
  - Email traffic should only be routed to email server and nowhere else
  - Web proxy go through proxy
  - All outbound packets must have valid source and destination addresses
  - All inbound packets must have valid source and destination addresses
- Virtual Firewall Machines
  - No dedicated hardware

#### Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)
- Takes care of both detection and prevention
- Types
  - Host-Based IDPS (HIDPS)
    - Compares hash values
    - Issue with system files which are updated
  - Network Based IDPS (NIDPS)
    - Signature or knowledge based NIDPS
      - Ex: Anti Virus
- Attack response
  - Log Suspecious activity
  - Drop Suspecious traffic
  - Render traffic benign
  - Notify a human
  - Modify its own configuration
  - Modify a firewall or router
  - Terminate a network connection
- Challenges
  - False positives
- IDPS Clipping
- IDPS Components
  - IDPS Management Station
  - IDPS Agents
    - Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)
    - Network Tap
- IDPS Load Balancing
  - Distribute to multiple agents
  - Distribute to agents based on volume
  - Distribute based on Source or Destination IP or Service protocol
- IDPS Limitations
  - Cannot handle ecrypted data
  - Cant handle high traffic loads
  - Susceptible
