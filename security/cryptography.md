#### Cryptography
- Encryption -  Plaintext to CipherText
- Decryption - CipherText to Plaintext

#### Cryptology
- Science of encryption
- 2 disciplines
  - Cryptography
  - Cryptanalysis
    - understanding ciphertext
- Encryption functions
  - Substitution
    - Shift characters by 3 positions
    - Mono alphabetic substitution
  - Transposition
    - Position is changed
- Direction
  - Symmetric encryption
    - Encryption and Decryption uses the same algorithm and the same key
    - Standard is AES ( -128, -192, -256)
    - Also known as Private key encryption
  - Asymmetric encryption
    - A.K.a Public key encryption
    - Public & private keys are mathematically related
    - Standard RSA
    - Used for Digital Signature
  - Hybrid
    - Use Asymmetric encryption to exchange Symmetric keys used for actual communication
    - Standard - Diffie-Hellman key exchange method

#### Public Key Infrastructure
- Digital certificate
- Certificate AUthority (CA)
- Registration Authority (RA)
- Certificate directories
- Management protocols
- Policies & Procedures
